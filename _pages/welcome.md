I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Oklahoma State University in the Department of Computer Science under [Dr. Johnson Thomas](https://www.cs.okstate.edu/~jpt/). My primary research interests are in the fields of Machine Learning and Bio-inspired decision-making models. My research focuses on the analysis and implementation of neural computational models inspired by the human brain using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While several studies specify mathematical and theoretical realizations of biologically inspired models, there is a lack of practical application and implementation of such models. My research addresses such limitations by marrying the theoretical and practical aspects of implementing biological models with emphasis on tractable design and practical use cases by solving computational tasks of pattern recognition and prediction.

Supplementing my research on computational models, I am also interested in applying Machine Learning to understand the functionalities of the human brain by studying various research done in this field. As I move towards my graduation, I am looking to solve challenging problems in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This website showcases my projects as I tackle some real-world data using skills gained during my time as a Ph.D. research scholar in Computer Science.
